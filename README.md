A tool that facilitates the Pi Pico / PicoW workflow by providing a simple GUI that allows users to enter the bootloader mode without unplugging the Pico as well as uploading U2f files without tedious dragging and dropping.



Built on the processing core for simplicity. Uses G4P for the interface.
